This script may be used to "disassemble" a PDF document into its component parts, printing
them to stdout. Useful for debugging purposes.

Options:
  -h    Show this message and exit.
  -H    Show the options offered by the Python executable.

Notes:
  * PATH should be a readable PDF document, that gets passed to the
    Python disassembler.
